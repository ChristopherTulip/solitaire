# Blank Node Project

Starting point so that I don't need to do config and set up whenever I want to build a new site. I've set this project up in such a way that I think is reasonably clean... until I find some better way to do it.

## Using
  - [express](http://expressjs.com/) because YOLO
  - [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for simplicity
  - [jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade) for HTML markup
  - [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) for CSS preprocessing
    - [nib](https://github.com/visionmedia/nib) because it's great
